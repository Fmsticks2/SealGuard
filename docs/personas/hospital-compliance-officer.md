## Quotes & Testimonials

### Current State Quotes
*"Every audit feels like a gamble - we think our documentation is complete, but we can never be 100% certain until the auditors finish their review."*

*"I spend more time creating compliance reports than actually improving our compliance posture. It's backwards."*

*"When regulators ask us to prove our data hasn't been tampered with, we show them our policies and procedures. But that's not really proof - it's just documentation."*

### Desired Future State
*"I want to click a button and have mathematical proof that our patient data is exactly as it was when we stored it."*

*"Imagine being able to tell auditors: 'Here's cryptographic proof that this medical record is authentic and unaltered.' That would be a game-changer."*
