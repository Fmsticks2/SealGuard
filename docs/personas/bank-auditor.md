## Quotes & Testimonials

### Current State Quotes
*"Every quarter, we spend weeks manually testing transaction samples, knowing we're only looking at a tiny fraction of the total population."*

*"When external auditors ask us to prove our transaction logs are complete and unaltered, we show them our database controls. But that's not really mathematical proof."*

*"I worry that we're missing something in our manual testing that could lead to a material weakness finding."*

### Desired Future State
*"I want to be able to tell our external auditors: 'Here's cryptographic proof that every transaction in our logs is authentic and unaltered.'"*

*"Imagine being able to focus on risk analysis instead of spending most of our time on data gathering and verification."*

*"If we could automate our data integrity testing, we could complete audits faster and with greater confidence."*

This persona represents a key decision influencer for SealGuard in financial institutions, with specific pain points around transaction log integrity and audit efficiency that our solution directly addresses through automated cryptographic verification.
