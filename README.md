# SealGuard - Immutable Audit Trail System

*Built on Filecoin Onchain Cloud for Regulated Industries*

## 🎯 Project Overview

SealGuard is a compliance-focused SaaS platform that creates immutable, cryptographically verifiable audit trails for sensitive documents and logs. Built on Filecoin Onchain Cloud, it serves regulated industries including healthcare, finance, and legal sectors by providing trustless, scalable integrity verification.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### The Compliance Crisis in Regulated Industries

Regulated industries face mounting pressure to maintain comprehensive, tamper-proof audit trails while navigating increasingly complex compliance requirements:

**Healthcare (HIPAA Compliance)**
- Medical records must maintain integrity for 6+ years
- Patient data breaches cost $10.93M on average (IBM, 2023)
- Current systems lack cryptographic proof of data integrity
- Manual audit processes are time-intensive and error-prone

**Financial Services (SOX, GDPR, Basel III)**
- Transaction logs require immutable storage for regulatory review
- Financial institutions face $4.88M average data breach costs
- Legacy systems vulnerable to insider threats and data manipulation
- Compliance officers struggle with proving data authenticity during audits

**Legal Industry (Attorney-Client Privilege, Discovery)**
- Legal documents need verifiable chain of custody
- E-discovery processes require proof of document integrity
- Current document management systems lack cryptographic verification
- Risk of evidence tampering undermines case integrity

### Why Current Solutions Fail

1. **Centralized Vulnerabilities**: Traditional systems have single points of failure
2. **Lack of Cryptographic Proof**: No mathematical verification of data integrity
3. **Scalability Issues**: Legacy systems can't handle enterprise-scale data volumes
4. **Trust Dependencies**: Reliance on third-party attestations rather than cryptographic proof
5. **Cost Inefficiency**: Expensive compliance infrastructure with limited verifiability

**The Gap**: No trustless, scalable, cryptographically verifiable integrity solution exists for enterprise compliance needs.
